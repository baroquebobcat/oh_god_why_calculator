Oh God Why Calculator
=====================

Quite possibly the most ridiculously optimized calculator on the JVM.

Really, it's a small, fun project for playing w/ bitescript & kpeg.

A calculator that compiles each expression to bytecode before running it.

    $ rm calculator.kpeg.rb; kpeg calculator.kpeg && ruby run_calculator.rb
